## Description

The Prework-Study-Guide website is a starting point, as well as a point of refrence. This project is used to study notes, practice concepts, and store information. Solving the need for orginized notes, the Prework-Study-Guide website provides easy access to plenty of study material. This project has shown me the flow and frame work of the web development process, and lead me to a greater understanding of coding and tech as a whole.

## Usage

The Prework-Study-Guide project has been incredibly useful. The website is there not only for the user to study, but it assists in the process as well. Using a built in topic randomizer, the website relieves the user of deciding. The randomizer is accessed by right clicking and inspecting the website using Chrome DevTools, and switching to the 'Console' tab. From there simply refreshing the page generates new outputs.
